*** TO RETROACTIVELY IGNORE FILES

git rm -r --cached .

git add .

git commit -m "Reapply .gitignore rules"

git push origin main


        .gitignore doesn’t retroactively remove tracked files—you must explicitly remove them using git rm --cached.
        Running git rm -r --cached . forces Git to reprocess all ignored files, fixing lingering tracking issues.
        Avoid using "Discard All Changes" in VS Code when dealing with venv/, as it can delete critical files instead of untracking them.
        If a tracked folder keeps reappearing, fully clearing the cache and reapplying .gitignore is the best way to stop Git from tracking it.
